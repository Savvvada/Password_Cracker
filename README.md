# Password_Cracker
This is a small program which uses password lists to decrypt the entered hash
To run thi program one must make sure that the password list they wish to use is in the same directory as the program itself.  
Afterwards, one only needs to start the program and they will be immediately prompted to enter the hash they wish to be decrypted. It is imperative to make sure there are no whitespaces following the pasted hash.
Subsequently, the program will prompt the user again for input, this time for the name of the textfile containing the passwords they wish to decrypt. The extension must be added to it.
After entering the textfile name from the ones included in the directory, the program should run.
